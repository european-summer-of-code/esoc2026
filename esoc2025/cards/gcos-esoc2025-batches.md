### Application forms

The deadline to complete all of these is April 9, 18:00 (UTC) for batch 1, or May 14, 18:00 (UTC) for batch 3.

1. Fill in and submit the [ESoC application form](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/european-summer-of-code_european-summer-of-code-activity-7308135810648715264-RbpO)

2. Fill in and submit the [Project application form](https://forms.office.com/e/GhGWQLdseU).

After the deadline has passed, we will process the information provided and tell you the outcome no later by the date indicated above. There are two possible outcomes:

- Progress to interview. See below.
- Rejection.

### Interview

If successful in the above steps, we will invite you to a structured interview (ca. 30 to 60 minutes length; to be finalised) with a panel that consists of members of the partner organisation, and GC.OS staff, or affiliates from open source projects.

The interview will happen in a designated two-week that differs per batch (see above). Please keep these preferred dates indicated free if possible.

During the interview:

- we will ask you to give a short (5 to 10 minutes; to be finalised) presentation on a piece of Python code that you wrote. Please be ready to screen share your code or to send a link to the repo containing your code.
- we will ask about your motivation, your previous experience, your suitability for the specified project, and technical questions on data science and Python.

After the interview, the panel will rank all candidates. This ranking is the final ranking.

When we inform you of the outcome of the interview, there are two possibilities:

* Acceptance. This is an offer for the project, and you will have time to accept and review terms and conditions (such as data sharing agreements).
* Waitlist acceptance. This means you are on the waitlist for the project, and you will be offered a slot if higher ranking candidates withdraw, e.g., due to accepting an offer with another project, or if the relevant sponsor decides to increase their stipend budget upon multiple good selection performances.
* A rejection.

### Selection criteria

In the above, the following are used for selection:

* experience with python programming and AI tools
* experience with relevant technologies for the project
* performance in the structured interview (for content see above)
* prior contributions to open source python in general, if applicable
