## Why PTF?

Pytorch forecazsting ``PTF``, under the umbrella of `sktime`, aims to be a comprehensive and multipourpose deep learning-based time serie toolbox. In the version V2 we aim to extend the current implementation:
* adding SOTA multi output-multi multi-horizon time series forecasting DL models (encorder-decorder, foundational, customizable architectures)
* updating the list of loss functions and optimizers specifically designed for time series forecasting
* focusing on reproducibility (train-validation-test split, normalization, seeding)
* traking the training process for detecting over-under fitting 
* enanching the training procedure with hyperparameter-optimization functionalities
* implementing benchmarking between datasets and architectures
* exposing HPC's connectors 

The PTF V2 will be based on other open source projects such as [DSIPTS](https://github.com/agobbifbk/DSIPTS_PTF), [Time-Series-Library](https://github.com/thuml/Time-Series-Library) and [sktime](https://github.com/sktime/sktime).

**Are you ready for this?**

## Application process

Please follow the  application process for `sktime` affiliated projects:

https://github.com/sktime/mentoring/blob/main/internships/esoc2025.md

## Proposal Detail

The selected candidate will:
* refactor some of the core functionalities of `PTF`:
    * data-layers: processing time series data in different sources: single csv, multiple csv, zarr files
    * dataloaders: standardizing the batch generation for groups of DL architectures (e.g. encoder-decorder, foundational)
    * model-layer: implementing common training-prediction procedures based on [lightning](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/)
* enrich the set of loss functions and optimizers
* add new functionalities:
    * benchmarking
    * optimization
    * HPC interface (for example using  [hydra](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/) sweepers)

## Mentors
The project is sponsored by [Fondazione Bruno Kessler](https://www.fbk.eu/it/), [Digital Industry center](https://www.fbk.eu/it/digital-industry/), [DSIP unit](https://dsip.fbk.eu/) and  will be jointly mentored by the DSIP unit (Andrea Gobbi, main developer of [DSIPTS](https://github.com/agobbifbk/DSIPTS_PTF)) and from members from GC.OS (`PTF` and `sktime` library).
