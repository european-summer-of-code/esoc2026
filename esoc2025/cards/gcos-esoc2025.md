For questions about the process, please contact `info(at)gcos(dot)ai` or the [LinkedIn page for ESoC](https://www.linkedin.com/company/european-summer-of-code/)

## Applied project set-up

European Summer of Code is a paid stipend programme, throughout 2025.

* ESoC stipend holder participate in onboarding events, regular stand-ups and mentoring throughout the period
* collaboration is virtual, via GitHub and Discord, or similar tools. Some partner organisations may optionally offer hybrid or in-person collaboration.
* full time dedication to the stipend project is expected throughout the mid-year period (12 calendar weeks), excluding 5 working days of pause.
* flexible time arrangement are possible, at discretion of partner organisations - but 3 months continuous full time availability is normally expected
* the internship is accompanied by a pro-rata based on a flat stipend of 4.800 Euro for 3 months full-time equivalent (= 1.600 Euro per month, for 3 months). Disbursement is via stipend through the ESoC hub GC.OS (German Center for Open Source AI)
* the internship does not constitute formal employment, nor are there delivery expectations. Reimbursement at the discretion of GC.OS.
* the project may require signing a data sharing agreement. In this case, the agreement will be shared and can be reviewed by candidates before accepting the stipend.

Optionally, projects may offer additional mentored participation for ranking candidates, or for candidates who are unable to participate with full time dedication. Mentoring slots may be unpaid or paid at a lower rate.

### full time dedication requirement

For avoidance of doubt:

* "full time dedication" is a contractual condition, and mutually exclusive with other full time engagements, such as employment, or alternative paid stipend programmes of similar nature
* for disbursement of stipend, the stipend project must be the primary professional activity, measured at >80% of total professional time over the stipend period

Optional mentored slots may not require full time participation. The exact conditions for being offered a mentored slot are at the discretion of the project, and are typically outlined on the project card.

## The application process

Here is the timeline for the application process.
Dates are relative to the release of the project.

- day 0 = T. Release of the project, announcements
- T plus 2 or 3 calendar weeks, 18:00 (UTC), rounded up - see exact time on projects page. First stage. You must complete all first round application steps by this deadline. This includes the ESoC application, and the GC.OS application form, and any first stage entrance tasks (if specified).
- First stage entrance tasks are listed in the project card, e.g., opening a PR to an open source repository. Not all projects have this.
- At latest T plus 4 calendar weeks, 18:00 (UTC) = T2. We inform you of the first stage outcome (proceed to interview) *latest*.
- two calendar weeks after T2. Second stage. Interviews happen during this time. Preferred days are Monday and Tuesday. You may prefer to keep these days free.
- Calendar week 3 after T2, at latest. We take at most one week to inform you of the final interview outcome.
- Calendar week 4 after T2, at latest (calendar week 8 after T). The project starts.

If you get stuck or have questions, please feel free to reach out to us on [the GitHub discussion forum](https://github.com/european-summer-of-code/esoc2025/discussions), or directly via `info(at)gcos(dot)ai`.


### Application forms

The deadline to complete all of these is T plus 2 or 3 calendar week, 18:00 (UTC), rounded up, where T is the time of first project announcment. This is the same deadline as indicated in the project card or on the webpage, where the exact day will be named.

1. Fill in and submit the [ESoC application form](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/european-summer-of-code_european-summer-of-code-activity-7308135810648715264-RbpO)

2. Fill in and submit the [Project application form](https://forms.office.com/e/GhGWQLdseU).

After the deadline has passed, we will process the information provided and tell you the outcome no later by the date indicated above. There are two possible outcomes:

- Progress to interview. See below.
- Rejection.

### Interview

If successful in the above steps, we will invite you to a structured interview (ca. 30 to 60 minutes length; to be finalised) with a panel that consists of members of the partner organisation, and GC.OS staff, or affiliates from open source projects.

The interview will happen in a designated two-week that differs per project (see above). Please keep these preferred dates indicated free if possible.

During the interview:

- we will ask you to give a short (5 to 10 minutes; to be finalised) presentation on a piece of Python code that you wrote. Please be ready to screen share your code or to send a link to the repo containing your code.
- we will ask about your motivation, your previous experience, your suitability for the specified project, and technical questions on data science and Python.

After the interview, the panel will rank all candidates. This ranking is the final ranking.

When we inform you of the outcome of the interview, there are two possibilities:

* Acceptance. This is an offer for the project, and you will have time to accept and review terms and conditions (such as data sharing agreements).
* Waitlist acceptance. This means you are on the waitlist for the project, and you will be offered a slot if higher ranking candidates withdraw, e.g., due to accepting an offer with another project, or if the relevant sponsor decides to increase their stipend budget upon multiple good selection performances.
* A rejection.

### Selection criteria

In the above, the following are used for selection:

* experience with python programming and AI tools
* experience with relevant technologies for the project
* performance in the structured interview (for content see above)
* performance in the entrance task, if applicable
* prior contributions to open source python in general, if applicable
